#10th meeting
In this cool session, we are with QR code, date, and turtle libraries! Yes, we met the turtle
The work of the library is to draw turtles in different shapes
The job of the date library is to show the time and calculate the age, etc
For practice, we made rock, paper, scissors, my regiment, and many other cool things
Take a look at my code to see them.
